# Short video showing WIP data display with gestures. 
* Screen zoom is limited to a reasonable degree based on magnitude of input data. 
* When zoomed all the way out, user cannot scroll outside of their data set and is locked to it. 
* When zoomed in, user can scroll and pan the display around, but only as far as the limits of the graph, and axis are always kept on screen.
